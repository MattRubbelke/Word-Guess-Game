# Word-Guess-Game

# About the game and what it does

Guess the first name of the drag queen winner from each season of RuPaul's Drag Race.
The user guesses by pressing a key on the keyboard. 

# How can the user get started

The user's input is checked to see if it matches any of the letters of the answer. 
If correct, the user's input will replace the corresponding underscore and be added 
to the Guessed Letters Div. If incorrect, the number of Guesses Left will subtract. 

If the user guesses all the letters, a picture of the Drag Queen will appear, along with 
congratulatory text. The user will need to refresh to continue to play.

If the user does not guess all the letters, a gif of RuPaul will appear, along with Game
Over text. The user will need to refresh to start over. 

# Have fun! This game is all about fun. 

# If bugs appear...
refresh the page. After testing, I noticed the game will sometimes not register all the letters. 
This generally happens if the user has played the game in-excess (usually 6 plus).
